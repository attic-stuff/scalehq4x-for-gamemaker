# scalehq4x pixel art filter

### but for gamemaker



this is a gm ready implementation of guest.r's scalehq4x pixel art filter. it is not xbr, it ain't hq4x either but apparently there is a history of people getting these two mixed up. some real video game freaky friday fun.

anyways this is a post processing effect, which means you need to apply it to the whole app surface and not just individual sprites. this means: disable automatic app surface drawing, then draw it yourself. it will turn crisp and pretty pixel art into cool not so crisp pixel art.
