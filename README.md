# scalehq4x pixel art filter

### but for gamemaker



this is a gm ready implementation of guest.r's scalehq4x pixel art filter. it is not xbr, it ain't hq4x either but apparently there is a history of people getting these two mixed up. some real video game freaky friday fun.

anyways this is a post processing effect, which means you need to apply it to the whole app surface and not just individual sprites. this means: disable automatic app surface drawing, then draw it yourself. it will turn crisp and pretty pixel art into cool not so crisp pixel art. feel free to use this shader and any relevant gml wherever you want just remember dos things: do not use the artwork anywhere, and do not distribute the shader (or include it in your sick game) without retaining the original copyright notice. don't do the og dirty.

download the yyz and open it up for a quick checkeroo or peruse the code.
